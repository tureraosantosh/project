Yesterday's session : Maven Project Folder Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Maven project contains pom.xml file which acts as maven configuration file

-> All the dependencies which are required for our application we will add in pom.xml file only

Note: We can identify maven dependencies in mvnrepository.com website

---------------------------------Adding maven dependency----------------
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
        <version>5.3.6</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> We can add multiple dependencies under <dependencies/> tag in pom.xml file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> To perform application build process maven provided several goals for us

	1) clean

	2) compile

	3) test

	4) package

	5) install etc.


-> 'clean' goal is used to delete target folder

-> 'compile' goal is used to compile java classes and generate .class files in target folder

-> 'test' goal is used to execute junit classes available in application for unit testing

-> 'package' goal is used to generate 'jar' or 'war' file for our application

-> 'install' goal is used to represent our project as dependency for other projects
