-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> In one project mulitple developers will be available

-> Developers will be working from different locations.

-> If developers are working from multiple location we will face below problems

		2) Monitoring code changes


-> To resolve the above 2 problems we will use Version Control Softwares.

		1) Clear Case
		2) CVS
		3) SVN
		4) GIT Hub
		5) Bit Bucket etc..

-> In Git account we will create repository to store project source code.

	Note: For one project we will create one repository

Note: In IT company, GIT admin will create repository for the project.

-> In Git we can create 2 types of repositories.

		1) Public Repository

		2) Private Repository

-> Public Repository means anybody can see and we will choose who can commit

-> Private repository means we will choose who can see and commit to our repository.
