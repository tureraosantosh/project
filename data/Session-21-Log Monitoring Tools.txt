Last session : Application Environments amd Deployment Process
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> For every project devops team will be available and they are responsible to create environments required for our application.

-> We will send an email for devops team to create jobs for our application deployment.

-> When we need to deploy the application we have to run the job which is created by devops team in jenkins software.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> If our code is not working as expected in local env then we will use Debugging technique to understand the problem and we will fix it.

-> If code is not working in higher environments then we will check log files to identify the problem.

****** For every project logging will be implemented in realtime*********

-> We will use 'Log Monitoring Tools' to check log messages of our application.
