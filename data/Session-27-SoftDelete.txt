Today's session : soft delete functionality
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> In application we can implement 'Delete' functionality in 2 ways

		1) Hard Delete
		2) Soft Delete
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> The process of deleting the record(s) permanently from the DB is called as Hard Delete.

-> To perform Hard Delete we will execute 'delete' query directley.

	Ex: DELETE FROM CONTACT_DTLS WHERE CONTACT_ID = 101;

Note: Once we delete record from DB using DELETE query then we can't get that record back.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> The process of deleting the record(s) from the application but not from the DB is called Soft Delete.

-> To perform Soft Delete operation we will maintain additional column in DB.

		Ex: ACTIVE_SW
			Y = Not Deleted
			N = DELETED

-> To perform Soft delete we will execute Update Query instead of Delete query.

-> If we do soft delete, we can get the data back from DB bcz data will be there in DB.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pagination
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> The process of dividing all records and displaying in multiple pages is called as pagination.

		Ex: Gmail, Google Search Results...

-> To implement pagination we have to decide page size.

	Ex: Page Size :10  (For each page 10 records should be displayed)
