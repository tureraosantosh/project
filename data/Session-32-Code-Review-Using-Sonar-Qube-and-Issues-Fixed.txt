Last session : Code Review Using Sonar Qube
--------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
To perform code review for project we have to do below 2 things

	1) Download and Run Sonar Server

	2) Add Sonar-Maven-Plugin in pom.xml and run (goal -> sonar:sonar)

-> When we perform code review using sonar qube it will generate report with below details

1) Bugs

2) Vulnerabilities

3) Code Smells

4) Code Coverage

5) Duplicate Code

-> Bugs means the problems available in source code (we have to fix them)

-> Vulnerabilities are security issues (hackers can attack)

-> Code smells are the issues which are recommended to fix

-> Code Coverage related to Unit testing

-> Duplicate code means the repeated code which is available in project.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> In project if we want to declare variables like password and ssn we should not declare them directley.

-> Instead of declaring password we will declare it as pazzword

-> Instead of declaring ssn we will declare it as zzn
