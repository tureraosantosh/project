Session-43-Read-Email-Body-YML

Last session : Email functionality in 02-Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Once user registered in our application then our application is responsible to send email to the registered user to unlock his/her account

-> In email body we need to display temporary password and hyperlink to unlock account.

-> Email body content having some static text and some dynamic text.

-> For email body we have created a text file (email body template)

-> In our program we will read that mail body from text file and will replace with dynamic values and will use that for body.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> To read the data from text file in java we have below classes

	1) FileReader
	2) BufferedReader

-> FileReader class will read the data from file character by character

-> BufferedReader will read data from the file line by line

Note: BufferedReader can't read the data from file directley. We will connect FileReader object with BufferedReader object to read data line by line.

private String readUnlockAccEmailBody(UserAccountEntity entity) {
		StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(AppConstants.EMPTY_STR);
		String mailBody = AppConstants.EMPTY_STR;
		try {
			String fileName = appProps.getMessages().get(AppConstants.UNLOCK_ACC_EMAIL_BODY_FILE);
			FileReader fr = new FileReader(fileName);
			BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);
			String line = br.readLine();

			while (line != null) {
				sb.append(line);
				line = br.readLine();
			}
			br.close();

			mailBody = sb.toString();
			mailBody = mailBody.replaceAll(AppConstants.FNAME, entity.getFname());
			mailBody = mailBody.replaceAll(AppConstants.LNAME, entity.getLname());
			mailBody = mailBody.replaceAll(AppConstants.TEMP_PWD, entity.getPazzword());
			mailBody = mailBody.replaceAll(AppConstants.EMAIL, entity.getEmail());
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

		return mailBody;
