Last session : What is Batch & Why We need Batches
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Batch is a program which is used to perform bulk operation.

-> Batches are used to automate the process

-> In Correspondence module we have batches to generate and send notices to citizens.

-> Every batch will have a frequency

-> Based on frequency we will schedule batch execution using scheduling tool.

-> To schedule batches execution based on frequency we will have Batches Team for that.

-> Opcon is one of the famous batch scheduling tool


	Scheduling tool --> script file ---> batch program ----> database
