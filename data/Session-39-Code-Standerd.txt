Last session : How to read data from YML file into Java class.
Session-39-Code-Quality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> It is not at all recommended to hard code application messages in java program.

-> If we want to change any message text then we have to modify our java program.

-> If we modify source code then we have build and deploy the entire application.

-> Building and Deploying entire application is time consuming process.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> To avoid this problem we can store application messages in yml file and we can read from there.

-> If we change any message text in yml, build and deployment is not required just server re-start is sufficient to load latest msgs from yml.

-> Server restart will take 1-2 mins only.
