Session-49-Exception-Handling-In-REST-API
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> We can handle exceptions in 2 ways

		1) Global Exception Handling Mechanism
		2) Controller Based Exception Handling Mechanism

-> Global Exception Handling means it will be applicable for entire application.

-> Controller Based Exception Handling means it will handle the exceptions occured in that particular controller.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> When we are doing any experiment or when we are implementing any functionality for first time don't directley implement in project.

-> First develop a POC (Proof Of Concept) and show that POC to higher management (Lead / Manager).

-> Once your POC got approved by Lead or Manager then you can implement that in project.
