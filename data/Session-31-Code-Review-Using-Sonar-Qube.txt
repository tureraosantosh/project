-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today's session : Session-31-Code-Review-Using-Sonar-Qube
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Sonar Qube is an open source software which is used to perform Code Review

-> Sonar Qube supports for 27 programming languages

-> Sonar Qube provided 'Community Edition' to use it for free of cost

Note: We have commericial plans also for using Sonar Qube
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running Project with SonarQube Server
-------------------------------------
Add below 1 plugin in project pom.xml file (in <build> tag)

<plugin>
   <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
   <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>3.4.0.905</version>
</plugin>

-> Do Maven build of project with install goal
	
	mvn clean compile package install

-> For project do maven build with below goal To Do Code Review
	
	mvn sonar:sonar

-> After maven build completed, check sonar server dashboard.
	
-> We can our project report under Projects

-> Report contains below details
	
		1) Bugs(Blocker, Critical, Major & Minor)
		2) Vunerabilities
		3) Code Smells
		4) Code Coverage
		5) Duplicates etc...

-> Bugs means the problems available in source code like ArthematicException, NullPointerException, Resource Leak etc (We have to fix them)

-> Vunerabilities nothing but security issues (If we don't fix these hackers can attack). We have to fix them

-> Code Smells are minor issues available in code. Recommneded to fix
    (private methods which are not called, un-used imports, un-used method parameters etc)

-> Code Coverage represents how much code we have covered in Unit Testing.

-> Duplicates represents in how many places we have written same logic in project.
